        3d modelling has been a part of my practice since 2023, after taking a <i>Virtual Reality</i> course at 
        <i>The School of the Art Institute of Chicago</i>. this soft introduction to Unity & Blender sparked 
        my love for the medium, && since then i have been studying & practicing 3D. my background in web design 
        & coding combined with my newfound love for modelling developed into an interest for game developmemt. 
        after taking courses such as <i>Experimental 3D</i> - focused on Maya, <i>Art Games</i> & <i>Experimental 
        Game Lab</i> - both focused on scripting using C# via VSCode, as well as creative asset creation & usage. 
        some softwares i am comfortable using for 3D include Maya, Blender, Womp, Unity, LumaAI & VSCode.

        a lot of my first projects were focused on modelling objects that i had around the house. experimentation is an 
        important part of my process, && trying out new softwares 
       is a great way to learn while having fun & creating pieces i couldn't have imaginged before actually making them. 
       when developing video games, i like to build my assets myself to have more  control - both aesthetically & structurally. 
       i often shade my objects within Unity in order to acheieve the effect i want.
